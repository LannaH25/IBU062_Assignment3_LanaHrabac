To setup DHCP we first need to open Router's CLI tab. Then we enter "enable" to give us access to execute commands. To enter
global configuration mode we type "configure terminal". We first exclude router IP addreses from DHCP assignment so they
won't be assigned to hosts. Then we configure each DHCP pool for the first and the second switch. It would look something 
like this: 
ip dhcp pool Switch0
network 168.90.0.0 255.255.0.0
default-router 168.90.0.1
exit
The same process goes for the second switch:
ip dhcp pool Switch1
network 210.3.14.0 255.255.255.0
default-router 210.3.14.1
exit
To save the configuration we use the command: write memory.
